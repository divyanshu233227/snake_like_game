#Py_Move_and_Collide
###Discription-
It is pygame code with movement, collision procedurely generated collision's already seted up so you can focous on other things 
like level building and etc. It's as simple as that.

###How to use -
By changing the paremeters like speed, character size,screen size and etc get the movement.
procedurely generated collectables have been implemented so that you can use them if you want.

###Motivattion-
although pygame is easy it takes a learning curve to actually properly understand it,
I always wanted to have a basic movement setup so that I can play around with what else I cand do,
